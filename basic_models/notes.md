# Things covered

**ng-model**
used to make a two way databinding with model and view.
  - This made the live preview section possible
**ng-options**
used to cycle through options for select tag. The scope is the ReviewController. Only works if ng-model is present

**ng-submit**
used on the form tag. I used it to execute addReview() and update the reviews shown on the page after a user submits a new one.
