# Things focused on

**currency filer**
Filters output of an expression returning integers/floats

- used this filter for toy.price. Correctly formatted the floats as currency.
**ng-click**
Executes expression when element is clicked
**ng-class**
Adds a class to the given element if the expression results to true
**ng-src**
Correctly embedds expressions within the html src tag

I also created controller methods to

- set the value of a tab (for use with ng-click)
- check the value of a tab (for use with ng-class)
